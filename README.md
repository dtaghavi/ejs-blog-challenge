# ejs-blog-challenge
This was a challenge from "The Complete 2020 Web Developer Bootcamp" by https://www.londonappbrewery.com/ course I am doing.

How to use:

npm install first to download the dependancies
run the server that listens on port 3000. app.js

Once you're there you can go to /compose to create a new blog post. It will then redirect you to home page.
On the Home page you will now see your new post with a small preview of the post and a link to view the full post.

If you click Read More, it will direct you to the dynamically created page for each post.


About:

All this is done using EJS templating, Node.js with express and a couple other dependacies.
